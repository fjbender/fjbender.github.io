We don&rsquo;t log the response to the webhook call anywhere, but anyone can replay the webhook payloads (including the merchant themselves) to see any eventual error messages that might come back.

After an interesting discussion in the Discord (you can sign up here), I wanted to look a bit more into where Test Cards even come from.
tl;dr They are proprietary per payment gateway.
And now what? Assuming you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with the three and/or four party card schemes, you might be asking yourself, which of the parties involved controls the test cards.

If, for example, you have a setup according to the ideal flow and the ERP partially ships an order, those line items are not updated by the webhook Mollie then sends. Even worse, it might lead to 500 errors that both confuse Mollie technical support and merchants alike.

We will not return the IBAN on API level (as e.g. RatePay does), as Klarna does not follow this type of white label approach. They want to position their brand directly towards the consumer.
At a minimum, the consumer will receive an email that looks like this</description></item><item><title>How to Connect Paypal to Mollie</title><link>https://idaikt.sporkify.net/how-to-connect-paypal-to-mollie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 08:44:09 +0100</pubDate><author>Florian Bender</author><guid>https://idaikt.sporkify.net/how-to-connect-paypal-to-mollie/</guid><description>How to connect your PayPal Account to Mollie Log in to Mollie Dashboard Settings &amp;gt; Profiles &amp;gt; Desired Profile Activate the toggle next to PayPal, should look like this: Click the button, get redirected to PayPal, enter PayPal Business email Then login normally There might be a permissions screen Finally, there should be a confirmation: Looks like this when you click the button and go back to Mollie</description></item><item><title>Server to Server Credit Card Tokenization</title><link>https://idaikt.sporkify.net/server-to-server-credit-card-tokenization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 16:44:48 +0100</pubDate><author>Florian Bender</author><guid>https://idaikt.sporkify.net/server-to-server-credit-card-tokenization/</guid><description>Server to Server Card Tokenization with Mollie Mollie in theory has an endpoint for server-to-server card tokenization. In order to have this explained to you, you have to provide a valid PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance.
This endpoint is, unfortunately, not suitable for card tokenization from an App context, as the Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP Header prevents this (I think, I don&amp;rsquo;t really do frontend).

It&rsquo;s actually funny, if it wasn&rsquo;t so sad. And also the slight dyslexia (and/or lack of command of the Latin language) of the person who wrote the response doesn&rsquo;t help either.
Let&rsquo;s think this through. Capitalized nouns indicate Magento concepts. fixed width font indicates a fixed technical term.
